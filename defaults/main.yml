# We ship our Instana Agent in two flavors: "dynamic" and "static".
# The static flavored agent comes with a JDK (Zulu OpenJDK in a recent
# version) and a set of all recent sensors that we ship on a daily basis.
# It is the perfect fit when you have strict firewall settings and don't
# want the agents to connect to the internet, ever.
# The dynamic flavored agent comes with a JDK as well, and downloads the
# required sensors on startup phase.
# Possible values: "static" | "dynamic".

# When you register with us you receive a string that makes the credentials you
